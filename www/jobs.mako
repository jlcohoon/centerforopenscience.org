Open source has changed how software development works, and we want to apply the same principles to the sciences. Everything we develop is exclusively <a href="http://github.com/CenterForOpenScience">free and open source</a>.</p>

We focus on Python in that Python developers typically value readability and community, and we are missioned with connecting and educating the open science and open source communities. The Python community represents what an effective community should look like and has strong ties to the sciences. As long as your values are aligned with those, we want to hear from you.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="http://cos.io">Center for Open Science</a> is a funded non-profit startup looking for OSS senior developers, with 10+ years of professional software development experience, who are passionate about modern web and API practices, love science, and posses expertise across the web development stack. Open source has changed how software development works, and we want to apply the same principles to science. Everything we develop is exclusively free and open source.</p>

We believe that a great developer should be a great developer in any language. We focus on Python in that Python developers typically value readability and community, and we are missioned with connecting and educating the open science and open source communities. The Python community represents what an effective community should look like and has strong ties to the sciences. As long as your values are aligned with those, we want to hear from you.</p>

    <h3><strong>Where we live</strong></h3>
    <p>From hikes and rides atop the peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to navigating the taps of the BrewRidge Trail, Charlottesville boasts both urban culture and rural adventure. The pedestrian mall downtown offers local shopping, a range of restaurants from French fine dining to sushi rolls to take-away crepes, weekend farmer’s markets, and a music scene to suit tastes for both jazz piano and garage rock.</p>
    <p>Steeped with history, Charlottesville and the surrounding area offers many landmarks of its own. To branch out beyond the local without leaving the city, however, there are museums like the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Museum and the Special Collections Library at UVA. And, if you want to get out of town, DC is just two hours away and the state capital, Richmond, is a mere one-hour drive.</p>
